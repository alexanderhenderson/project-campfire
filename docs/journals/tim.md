Today we worked on setting up the project together in main

We started by creating a docker-compose.yml file and building the postgres and react containers in it.
We then created 3 different containers: events, messenger, and users and made a django project and app in each of the three containers and connected them to the database container.

The ah-ha moment of the day was gaining a greater understanding of setting up the volumes and databases within the docker-compose.yml
