Didn't have much time to work today, we got held up trying to extract the info from the token and then the mandatory fun event got in the way of really trying to work on our projects.

Kept on adding front-end components almost finished up the activities selection page.

Alex pretty much fixed up the Auth stuff today, 
I got a nav bar hooked up in react so we could link all of our pages up, kept building on front end implementations and components. 

## Tuesday, August 30, 2022

Finished backend last week so started to work on Front end stuff, had some hangups with Auth stuff and needed to get help from Andrew, finally worked it out, auth is almost finished.

Pair programmed with Tim to get the Users backend completely up to snuff, got the insomnia responding for each request we wanted to create views for. Joyce and Alex worked on getting the Events backend finished.

## Thursday, August 25, 2022
Had our first stand up, continued to work on views on users and events, Austin continued to work on google API stuff.
## Wednesday, August 24, 2022
Continued to build out views/models and got stuck on a M2M encoder Error (many related manager not json serializeable) for the entire day, eventually had curtis come in to help us after many hours and he created a super encoder to fix and serialize the data coming in from our views.

Started to build and design models for the events and users microservices
changed designs again after some deliberating, finally got some solid UBIQUITOUS language going and got a real understanding as to what the intention of the webapp was. Created some User stories, to simulate what kind of views we would need to create. 
## Monday, August 22, 2022
Changed our project idea after some thought,
spent the day working on design and getting together a MVP idea
worked on getting the microservices and docker compose configured. 

## Friday, August 19, 2022
we helped eachother get the docker compose up and running today. Using the learn commands and some team work, we got all 4 of our microservices up and running properly. Learning to integrate our git merges is going to be interesting. We also added some more to our Excalidraw, building on our projects design.
