Had our first stand up, continued to work on views on users and events, Austin continued to work on google API stuff.
## Wednesday, August 24, 2022
Continued to build out views/models and got stuck on a M2M encoder Error (many related manager not json serializeable) for the entire day, eventually had curtis come in to help us after many hours and he created a super encoder to fix and serialize the data coming in from our views.

Started to build and design models for the events and users microservices
changed designs again after some deliberating, finally got some solid UBIQUITOUS language going and got a real understanding as to what the intention of the webapp was. Created some User stories, to simulate what kind of views we would need to create.

Changed our project idea after some thought,
spent the day working on design and getting together a MVP idea
worked on getting the microservices and docker compose configured. 

## Friday, August 19, 2022
we helped eachother get the docker compose up and running today. Using the learn commands and some team work, we got all 4 of our microservices up and running properly. Learning to integrate our git merges is going to be interesting. We also added some more to our Excalidraw, building on our projects design.
