I created the react app and django project/app along with the docker
compose file so we could get the basic architecture of the project
set up.

We decided to change our project to a new idea that we were excited about.
We felt it was important to work on something we actually liked. Since we
pivoted, I had to rewrite the readmes' and used excalidraw to remap
everything. I also fleshed out all the other readme's that we had to
complete before it was due and created some wireframes of each page we
would want a user to see. We discussed domain driven design concepts
and tried to figure out what would be the best way to do the features
we wanted to implement. We also divyied up the work and decided to work
in partners / groups.
