## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
This is an interesting product that I would want to use. I have to imagine there are enough people who would want to use such an app that it is plausible in scale, though getting such a site to **critical mass** can be tricky. As part of your demonstration you might want to talk about how you would go about reaching critical mass.

### Scope of work
I feel like there is a lot of functionality to implement but don't have a clear idea about what the MVP is. You should figure out what the minimum product is, list those features, and then prioritize the rest in the order that you will add them if you have time. The process of doing that will not only make sure you have time to have a workable final project, but it will help you to focus your energies on the most important parts first and to get a working app deployed early. Deployment details can take up time really fast. 

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your integrations.md file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
