to create a user profile or log in to view the rest of the site if not
logged in.

## Kindler

This page is how users can find other people to do activities with. The
algorithm compares the logged in users activity list to all of the other
users, and returns the users with the most similar activities. It will not
return users that are already freinds with the logged in user or users with
no activities- or no shared favorite activities. The logged in user can add
users from the returned list to their freinds list.
