This file should contain the images that you sketch for your application. These screens should be low-fidelity because they're initial ideas. Don't waste time on coming up with color schemes and choosing fonts. You can do that later.

You can use any tool, really, to work on the screen designs:

Excalidraw  - what you know and "love"
Balsamiq Wireframes  - a tool with a 30-day free trial that has widgets built into it so you can quickly make low-fidelity screen designs
Figma  - A fancier tool that also has a free trial that's more complicated than the other two, and may end up being more of a time suck for you
You're looking to represent what will be on each screen, not try to create a pixel-perfect image.

The file should start with the main title.

# Graphical Human Interface
Then, for each screen design that you create in your tool, add a section. Save the screen design as an image in the wireframes directory. Then, you can include them in your ghi.md file using the image syntax.

For example, say you created a file named home-page.png in the wireframes directory. Afterward, you can write about it like this.

## Home page

This is the main page that people will see when they
get to the Web site.

![home page](wireframes/home-page.png)
Refer to the CommonMark documentation for the meaning of the syntax.
